            <h3>Research Summary</h3>
            <p>My Ph.D research is in Biostatics. My primary focus is clinical trials, specifically adaptive randomization in biomarker-driven trial design.  
                The following is a more detailed overview of my research interest and objective.</p>
            <p>
                For decades, cancers were traditionally classified by tumor location and staging,
                and approaches to drug development and clinical trial design mirrored this simplicity. 
                With the rapid development of gene sequencing techniques, most cancers now have refined classifications 
                recognizing tumor heterogeneity on a molecular level, and treatment strategies have shifted from eradicating
                 tumors to interrupting their molecular drivers of growth and spread. Statistical designs for clinical trials, 
                 however, have struggled to keep pace with continually evolving diagnostic classifications and novel treatment 
                 strategies, despite their central role in testing therapeutic hypotheses and translating scientific findings 
                 into clinical practice.  Progress is slowed when tumor biomarkers are collected on a therapeutic study and 
                 analyzed months or years after completion of a tradition study design, and ethical issues abound when it is learned
                  (years too late) that only a subset of patients enrolled on a study were benefiting from a marker-targeted therapy.
                In this new era of clinical cancer research and personalized medicine, where cancers are defined just as much (or moreso) by their molecular features as by their histologic type, 
                there is an urgent need for novel clinical trial designs that are capable of using emerging information (data) regarding the prognostic and predictive effects of tumor molecular features 
                to adapt trial endpoints, objectives, and patient accrual while the trial is still ongoing.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The ultimate purpose of my research is to develop novel statistical methodology to support “next generation” clinical trial designs for molecularly targeted cancer therapies. 
                Within the scope of my PhD thesis, I will address two major weaknesses of currently-employed biomarker-driven design approaches: 
                (1) simplification or misrepresentation of the prognostic or predictive effects of naturally continuous biomarkers
                 (e.g., expression levels or circulating tumor DNA) that are driving study design and could therefore lead to incorrect conclusions, and (2) 
                 fixed rather than adaptive treatment allocation ratios to marker-driven versus control therapy, despite accumulating 
                 information on-trial that could inform the treatment of enrolling patients on a personalized level. 
                 In my proposed thesis work, I will combine the machinery of Bayesian statistical theory with immediate access to individual
                  patient data from Children’s Oncology Group trials to inform development of impactful, clinically intuitive, and ready-to-implement 
                  trial design solutions to these current challenges. Specifically, I will develop a new statistical theoretical framework for biomarker-driven
                trial designs in which one or more naturally continuous markers with possibly non-linear or non-monotone effects are of interest to drive adaptive decision-making
                at interim and final analysis timepoints. These designs will allow for more accurate and precise real-time identification of patient subgroups who are benefiting
                from an experimental targeted therapy due to their avoidance of standard design manipulations (e.g. marker dichotomization) and assumptions (e.g., effect linearity
                 or monotonicity). Instead, a flexible Bayesian modeling “engine” will use accumulating patient, molecular, and outcome data to continuously (1) update estimates of 
                design-driving marker relationships, (2) quantify posterior uncertainty around these effects, and (3) translate the statistical information from (1) and (2) to personalize
                treatment allocation, such that a newly-enrolled patient’s probability of randomization to experimental therapy is a function of the their tumor marker value(s), the experimental 
                therapy’s trial performance to date among molecularly similar patients, and the degree of posterior (un)certainty in that performance.
