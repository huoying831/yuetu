            <h3>Research Summary</h3>
            <p>My Ph.D research is in Biostatics. My primary focus is clinical trials, specifically adaptive randomization in biomarker-driven trial design.  
                The following is a more detailed overview of my research interest and objective.</p>
            <p>
                For decades, cancers were traditionally classified by tumor location and staging,
                and approaches to drug development and clinical trial design mirrored this simplicity. 
                With the rapid development of gene sequencing techniques, most cancers now have refined classifications 
                recognizing tumor heterogeneity on a molecular level, and treatment strategies have shifted from eradicating
                 tumors to interrupting their molecular drivers of growth and spread. Statistical designs for clinical trials, 
                 however, have struggled to keep pace with continually evolving diagnostic classifications and novel treatment 
                 strategies, despite their central role in testing therapeutic hypotheses and translating scientific findings 
                 into clinical practice.  Progress is slowed when tumor biomarkers are collected on a therapeutic study and 
                 analyzed months or years after completion of a tradition study design, and ethical issues abound when it is learned
                  (years too late) that only a subset of patients enrolled on a study were benefiting from a marker-targeted therapy. There is an
                   urgent need for novel clinical trial designs that are capable of dynamic updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ultimate purpose of my research is to develop novel statistical methodology to support “next generation” clinical trial designs for molecularly targeted cancer therapies. 
               Specifically, I will develop a new statistical theoretical framework for biomarker-driven
                trial designs in which one or more naturally continuous markers with possibly non-linear or non-monotone effects are of interest to drive adaptive decision-making
                at interim and final analysis timepoints. These designs will allow for more accurate and precise real-time identification of patient subgroups who are benefiting
                from an experimental targeted therapy due to their avoidance of standard design manipulations  and assumptions (e.g., effect linearity
                 or monotonicity). Instead, the goal is to create a flexible Bayesian modeling “engine” will use accumulating patient, molecular, and outcome data to continuously update estimates of 
                design-driving marker relationships, quantify posterior uncertainty around these effects, and translate the statistical information to personalize
                treatment allocation.
