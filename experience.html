            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Before coming to USC, I spent a year at a clinical research organinzation where I worked on dynamic monitoring in clinical trials. 
                I became an adept programmer in R and SAS. I worked on model development and implementation. I was fortunate enough to collaborate with 
                several researchers, including Peng Zhang, Dr. Tai Xie, Dr. Wei-Chung Shih, Dr. K.K Gordon Lan, and Dr. Ping Gao. Through my interactions with them 
                I became more interested in methodology and trial design. With their encouragement and support, I took the next step forward to pursue a Ph.D in 
                Biostatistics.   
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                At USC, I am working mainly on my research goal of bringing adaptive randomization into clinical trial design. I am fortunate to be mentored by
                 <a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/lindsay-a-renfro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Lindsay Renfro</a>. In my Ph.D training, I've also dived deeper into Bayesian statistics, statistical inference, and computer programming. 
                Finally, I also have been able to learn about different areas within Biostatistics and increased my general understanding of the subject.
