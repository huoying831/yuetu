                    <p>
                        My name is Yue Tu (涂悦).  I am a third year Biostatistics Ph.D student in the Department of Population and <a  href="https://pphs.usc.edu/">Public Health Sciences at Keck School of Medicine</a> at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu">
                            University of Southern California. 
                        </a>
                        I am currently interested in clinical trials (mid and late phase), the application of Bayesian statistics, and biomarker analysis.</p>
                        <p>
                        I grew up in Beijing, China and attended Beijing Experimental High School, after which I decided to study abroad at the University of California, Los Angeles. There, I obtained my BS in Biochemistry and graduated magna cum laude.
                         I then went on to earn my Masters in Biostatistics at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health.
                        </p>
                     
                         
                         <p>
                             After obtaining my Masters, I worked as a biostatistician and programmer at a clinical research organization where I was responsible for clinical trial data analysis and also developed software for dynamic monitoring.
                         </p>
                         
                         <p>In my spare time, I might be found catching up on anime, playing with my dog Toast, reading, or watching movies.</p>
