            <p>
                I'm Yue Tu, currently a Ph.D student in Biostatics studying at the University of Southern California.</p>
            <p>
                I grew up in Beijing, China and attended Beijing Experimental High School, after which I decided to study abroad at the University of California, Los Angeles. There, I obtained my BS in Biochemistry and graduated magna cum laude.
             I then went on to earn my Masters in Biostatistics at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health.
             
             <p>
                 After obtaining my Masters, I worked as a biostatistician and programmer at a clinical research organization where I was responsible for clinical trial data analysis and also developed software for dynamic monitoring.
             </p>
             
             <p>In my spare time, I might be found catching up on anime, playing with my dog Toast, reading, or rapping.</p>

             <p> My CV can be found <a href="cv.pdf"> here</a></p>
